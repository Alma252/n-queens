# n-Queens Solver with Backtracking and Genetic Al gorithms

![sddefault](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c37467d-0ff7-44dc-b43e-bf6d8332a971)

## Overview
This project provides two solutions to the classic **n-Queens problem** — placing n queens on an n×n chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.  
It includes implementations of:  
- A **Backtracking** algorithm  
- A **Genetic Algorithm**  
Additionally, it features a user-friendly graphical interface built with **Tkinter** for interactive solving and visualization.
