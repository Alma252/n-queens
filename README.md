# n-Queens Solver with Backtracking and Genetic Algorithms

## Overview
This project provides two solutions to the classic **n-Queens problem** — placing n queens on an n×n chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.  
It includes implementations of:  
- A **Backtracking** algorithm  
- A **Genetic Algorithm**  
Additionally, it features a user-friendly graphical interface built with **Tkinter** for interactive solving and visualization.

## Features
- Solve n-Queens using Backtracking and Genetic algorithms  
- Interactive GUI to input board size and choose the algorithm  
- Visual display of the chessboard and queen positions  
- Easily extendable and customizable codebase  

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Run the main Python file:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
